    <p>I am an inspiring to be a backend developer, to achieve and be intitle as a backend web developer in the IT Industry, the most I do in fast years is creating a web application and learn by watching a free course tutorial about fundamental of C# and JavaScript, Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in C# and JavaScript, building a web application using asp.net, creating a User Interface (UI) design using HTML and CSS. </p>
    <p>One of the course tutorials “building an app with ASP.NET Core and angular from scratch” and it’s my first ASP.NET web application that I created and deployed. I learn and adopt the efficient way of creating a webapp using ASP.NET, in this course tutorial I learn in deep and familiarize to all I need to know about ASP.NET to write code and implementing of OOP and MVC to it. Also, in overall I love debugging an errors, because in this stage I critically think and analyze my code to know what is going on in line by line in that code block and after I debug the error, the feeling in my heart was priceless and thanks to my best friend “Google” for the help.</p>
    <p>And course tutorial about HTML and CSS was fulfilling my needs to create a user interface for my web application in the near future of my web development. </p>
